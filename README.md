To-Do List
------------

* Kernal is not Darwin, it's XNU - Change This
* Better way to install (don't dump straight into /bin , maybe install script?)
* Better way of choosing package manager (maybe as option rather then config?) 
* Look into $terminalText bug. Maybe find a better way of displaying colors then current method.
* Look into logo allignment in code (match what is dispalyed)
* Loop for assigning color variables (smaller code)
