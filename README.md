	color=$(tput setaf $lightblue)

Change the value of the variable packagehandler, to change the package handler. The options are listed under # Variables

	packagehandler=$macportpackages

To-Do List
------------

* Loop for assigning color variables (smaller code)
* Better way to install (don't dump straight into /bin , maybe install script?)
* Update Screenshots
* Look into logo allignment in code (match what is dispalyed)
* Better way of choosing package manager (maybe as option rather then config?) 
* Kernal is not Darwin, it's XNU - Change This
* Look into $terminalText bug. Maybe find a better way of displaying colors then current method.
