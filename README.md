Recent Changes
--------------

* Better way to install (don't dump straight into /bin , maybe install script?)
* Truncate long hostnames that are > 35 characters long.
* Display name of Operating System next to Version. For example. "Version OS X 10.9 - Mavericks"
* (Works for Bash 4. Still working on Bash 3.2 solution)

To-Do List
------------

* Better way of choosing package manager (maybe as option rather then config?) 
* Look into $terminalText bug. Maybe find a better way of displaying colors then current method.
* Look into logo allignment in code (match what is dispalyed)
* Loop for assigning color variables (smaller code)
* Display name of Operating System next to Version. For example. "Version OS X 10.9 - Mavericks"
